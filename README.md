# Vocabulary Trainer

This is the trainer for quick learning of the vocabulary of the foreign language. You have to write the correct words by their translations in the random order. After each attempt, the correct words get solved, and the wrong words must be repeated. The trainer ends when all words are written correctly and get solved.

To write the words and their translations, write them in "data.csv", like "&lt;word&gt;","&lt;translation&gt;" and type "Enter".

To start the program, install Python and run "python main.py" (Windows) or "python3 main.py" (Linux / macOS).
